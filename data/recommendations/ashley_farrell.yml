  Ryan Hageman has been my go to medic for years both on set and in construction. His experience in the film industry gives him the knowledge to react quickly and keep any location or crew safe. He constantly checks in and has always placed me with a great medic when unavailable.. as he is always working.

  I've so enjoyed working with his calm and efficient tactics and operates great under pressure. I look forward to working with him in the future.
