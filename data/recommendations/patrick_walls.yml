recommendation: >
  I worked with Ryan on a very complex and difficult React project, and he was an excellent member of our development team. It was clear throughout the project that Ryan brought great skill and experience, contributing excellent code every day. As someone newer to the field of web development, I learned a lot from Ryan in everyday communication, in reading his code, and by observing his example on the team. Ryan's hard work and leadership were indispensible to our team and I would recommend him for any company in the future.
