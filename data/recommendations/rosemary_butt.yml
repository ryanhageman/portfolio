  I had the pleasure of working with Ryan for a few short months. He was onboarded for his front-end development expertise and rolled onto the project to backfill for another senior developer. Joining the team already a few sprints in, Ryan showed himself engaged and a seasoned, strong contributor with excellent communication skills. As the QA Lead, I was particularly appreciative of his timely responses to QA questions on user stories under development. I hope our paths cross again some day!
