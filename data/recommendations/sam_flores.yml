recommendation: >
  To whom it may concern,

  I have had the pleasure of working alongside Ryan in a professional capacity for nearly ten years now. Ryan has a poise and demeanor that is comforting to all. He is respectful and kind during all of his encounters on set and I highly recommend him for any job where a medical professional might be needed.

  Best,
  
  Sam
