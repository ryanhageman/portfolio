  It's a pleasure to have an opportunity to work with Ryan together on several Rails projects in the last couple years. He helped us to upgrade our existing Rails application from 5.x to 6.x and developed a couple challenging and complex HR hiring applications with some unique requirements from our HR team.

  From completely no knowledge of our local system to quickly helping us to develop complex systems to meet our business needs, he is always our go-to person for any issues and questions. We communicate with Slack and Zoom effectively. 

  I remember clearly one time that we worked together to deploy the new applications into production. The process was not as smooth as expected, but Ryan stayed with me on Zoom troubleshooting remotely for many hours, eventually we got the application into production.

  He is an easy person to work with and has a lot of experience with Rails development. Ryan is definitely one the best developers that I have worked with.
